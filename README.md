# PR-exercise

## Steps:
1. **Fork** from https://github.com/itc-workshop/PR-exercise.
2. Use git clone to **clone** the repository you forked.
3. **Go to the folder** of the repo you have cloned. (most people forgot this step!!)
4. **Add a new txt file** with your username as the file name and type your group number inside the file.
5. **Commit and push** to your remote repository.
6. **Pull request** to the original repository.

**Remember to use your username as file name, and the file only contains group number!**
